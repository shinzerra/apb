Copy&Paste/Drag&Drop the folders in "apb" into your "APB Reloaded" directory, if you haven't changed this the default will be 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\APB Reloaded".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to steam, click games at the top, click "Add a Non-Steam Game To My Library...", add the "apbcfg.exe".
This allows you to launch the game through steam without the apb launcher with no shortcut.
